      <div class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-100 text-justify">
        <p class="mt-4">
          In a small village at the base of a mountain in feudal Japan lived a golden-furred cat named Tama. Her round,
          green eyes gleamed like jade, and she was a familiar sight as she prowled the rice fields, darted between
          market stalls, or basked atop the shrine roof. To the villagers, Tama was more than a cat; she was a symbol of
          protection.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          One evening, as the sky turned plum, Tama noticed a group of samurai entering the village, followed by a fox
          spirit. The fox had caused trouble before, stealing food and creating chaos. Tama knew the village was not
          safe.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          That night, as the village lay quiet, the fox crept in. Tama intercepted it, her fur bristling with
          determination. The fox chuckled, but Tama stood her ground, arching her back and hissing fiercely. The fox
          lunged, but Tama was swift, leaping onto a cart and toppling baskets. The noise woke the samurai.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The samurai emerged, swords glinting in the moonlight. Realizing its plan had failed, the fox fled into the
          forest.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The villagers gathered and saw Tama atop the fallen baskets. They cheered, filled with gratitude. The samurai
          bowed to their tiny hero.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          From that day, Tama was celebrated as the Guardian of the Mountain Village. The villagers built her a small
          shrine beside the market, with bells that chimed in the breeze. Each evening, Tama watched over her people,
          her jade eyes reflecting the warmth of the village she loved.
