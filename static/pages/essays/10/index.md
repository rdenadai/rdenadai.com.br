ChatGPT is the new player in the field! And it's here to stay! ChatGPT is a machine learning model created by OpenAI that has knowledge of the world up until 2021. This means that it doesn't know about all the things that happened in 2022, but that doesn't mean it's "stupid", it just means it has less "knowledge".

You may have heard of it, and like me, you may have been very surprised by what it can do. I tested its ability to create code (one of the many things it is "assumed to be good at"), and indeed it is very good (in some cases, it is even excellent). However, its flaws are also visible depending on what you want to accomplish. For example, when I asked it to write a simple machine learning model class (a Perceptron) in Python, it did very well. But for more complex and subtle tasks (like writing a simple PEG parser in Python), it wasn't as good, as it was missing a link between the crude code and the relationships between entities.

One aspect of code that I find to be a win-win is to ask ChatGPT to correct your code, suggest a better implementation, or improve your implementation. In this type of task, it is excellent and super helpful, making you super productive and your code even better.

After playing around with it a little bit, I thought to myself, why not have ChatGPT write a story for me? We've all seen previous versions writing stories, but how good is it now? So I started asking and tweaking the inputs a little bit. One thing I noticed is that the AI always tries to take the shortest path (just like us, perhaps?) and doesn't elaborate enough on parts of the story.

## The story

I thought about writing a Space Opera, but ChatGPT was very helpful in explaining to me that to write a good story, you need lots of ideas and information.

> Me: I would like to write a Space Opera ?

> ChatGPT: Writing a space opera can be a fun and rewarding experience. To get started, here are a few tips:

> - Develop your characters: Space operas often have a large cast of characters, each with their own motivations and goals. Take some time to think about who your main characters will be and what makes them unique.

> - Create a compelling plot: A space opera typically involves an epic conflict or quest, so think about what kind of story you want to tell and what obstacles your characters will face.

> - Build your world: A space opera takes place in a vast and complex universe, so spend some time building out the details of your world. This might include creating alien species, inventing new technologies, and establishing the rules and laws that govern your world.

> - Use descriptive language: Space operas are known for their grandeur and sense of wonder, so use descriptive language to convey the scale and majesty of your story.

> - Have fun: Above all, the most important thing is to have fun while you're writing. Space operas are meant to be epic and imaginative, so let your creativity run wild!

So, as an exercise i did only the first and last parts (have fun :) ... ).

## Develop your characters

I asked ChatGPT to give me the background and physical appearance of two characters for my Space Opera story. After some interaction (keep in mind, all the text written below is generated by ChatGPT, I just tweaked the ideas a little bit, telling it that Elysia was a blue-skinned alien), here are the results:

> Elysia is a blue-skinned alien from a distant planet called Valtoria, located in the outer reaches of the galaxy. Valtoria is a technologically advanced world, home to a highly intelligent and resourceful species of blue-skinned humanoids. Elysia grew up in a bustling city on Valtoria, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and advanced transportation systems.

> Elysia is a striking and distinctive-looking alien, with bright blue skin and a tall, slender build. She has long, flowing hair that is a slightly darker shade of blue than her skin, and it is styled in loose waves that fall down her back. Elysia has piercing green eyes that seem to glow with an inner fire, and she has a strong, angular jawline that gives her a fierce and determined expression. Despite her fearsome reputation as a bounty hunter, Elysia has a softer side, and she is known for her kindness and compassion. She often wears simple, functional clothing that allows her to move freely and comfortably, but she also has a taste for fine fabrics and jewelry, and she is not afraid to dress up when the occasion calls for it.

> Elysia was a happy and carefree young alien, with a bright future ahead of her. However, her life was forever changed when her younger sister was killed by Zander.

> Zander is a cruel and ruthless intergalactic criminal with a long list of crimes to his name. He comes from a distant planet called Kronos, which is known for its lawless and dangerous environment. Zander grew up as an orphan on the streets of Kronos, learning to survive by any means necessary. As he grew older, Zander turned to a life of crime, becoming a master thief and con artist. He quickly rose through the ranks of the criminal underworld, building a vast network of connections and allies. However, his greed and ambition eventually led him to cross paths with Elysia's younger sister, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Zander killed her without a second thought, leaving Elysia grief-stricken and determined to bring him to justice.

> Determined to bring Zander to justice, Elysia threw herself into the world of bounty hunting, using her combat skills and knowledge to track down and capture criminals throughout the galaxy.

> Elysia is a fierce and intelligent warrior, driven by a deep sense of loss and a desire to right the wrongs of the galaxy. She is also a loyal friend and teammate, always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. Despite her tough exterior, Elysia is compassionate and caring, and she will stop at nothing to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who have wronged her.

> Jack is a human bounty hunter who has been working in the galaxy for many years. He is in his middle age, with short, graying hair and a neatly trimmed beard. Despite the roughness of his profession, Jack takes care of his appearance, and he is often impeccably dressed in stylish yet practical clothing. He has a strong, athletic build, and he is skilled in both hand-to-hand combat and the use of various weapons. Despite his tough exterior, Jack is a kind and compassionate person at heart, and he has always been drawn to helping others.

> Jack grew up on a rough and dangerous planet called New Frontier, where he learned to fend for himself at a young age. He first started working as a bounty hunter to pursue his love for a girl named Sarah, who was the daughter of a famous bounty hunter known as "Warrior" William. He hoped that by joining the profession, he could prove himself worthy of her and win her heart. However, things did not go as planned, and Sarah was tragically killed by a group of criminals seeking revenge for the capture of one of their leaders by Jack and her father.

> Heartbroken and filled with a desire for justice, Jack stayed in the bounty hunting business, using his natural talent for tracking down his targets and his fearless attitude to succeed in some of the most dangerous missions.

> Jack has a deep-seated fear of failure, and he often struggles with anxiety and self-doubt. To cope with the stress and grief of Sarah's death, Jack turned to smoking as a way to calm his nerves and focus his thoughts. He can often be seen with a smoke in hand when he is on a mission, and he finds it hard to break the habit despite the dangers.

> Despite his flaws, Jack is a reliable and dedicated partner, and he always puts the safety of his team and the success of the mission first. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will stop at nothing to protect the innocent and bring justice to the galaxy.

> ---

> Jack and Elysia first met while working on separate bounties to capture a notorious thief known as "The Ghost," who had stolen a valuable artifact from a wealthy collector. The Ghost had evaded capture for years, and the reward for his capture was substantial. Both Jack and Elysia were determined to bring The Ghost to justice, and they initially competed against each other to see who could capture him first.

> However, things became complicated when The Ghost's accomplices began targeting both Jack and Elysia in an effort to protect their leader. Despite their initial competition, Jack and Elysia were forced to work together to evade the attacks and track down The Ghost. As they worked together, they realized that they made a formidable team, with complementary skills and a shared dedication to justice.

Besides some repetitions, i find it very good!

I keep it wonder, i have the characters physical descriptions, why not ?
If you've been following the AI from OpenAI, you'll know what I did next... I put the text descriptions into DALL-E, and voila! Below are Elysia and Jack's profile pics.
