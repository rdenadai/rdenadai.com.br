## Introduction

This book is great and an excellent read for all developers who are willing to dig deeper into the field and better understand how to become better. Not only in writing code, but in designing better code and following processes and best practices.

In the book, there‚Äôs an excellent description of devs who don‚Äôt care about code; they care about spitting out code like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. I can relate to that because, in places where I worked, I already saw people like that (unfortunately).

Anyway, here is the excellent quote. Let that sink into your mind and evaluate whether you are a Tactical Tornado.

**_"The tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion. When it comes to implementing a quick feature, nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. In some organizations, management treats tactical tornadoes as heroes. However, tactical tornadoes leave behind a wake of destruction. They are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work with their code in the future"_** by John K. Ousterhout on A Philosophy of Software Design, 2nd Edition

John also gave a great talk about his book at Talks at Google. Check it out!
