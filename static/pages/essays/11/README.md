In my previous post I had the idea of use ChatGPT to write down a Space Opera story. To start with, we model some characters (Elysia and Jack).
Also a villain, called Zander ...

By the end of the post, I use DALL-E to generate some portrait of our characters ... but i get explore more, and thought, to take this to the next level.
Over the months that passed people learned how to better use ChatGPT, given some initial prompts to make the AI behave more like some kind of professional.

This [github][1] repo, list a diverse range of initial prompts to give to ChatGPT, use with wisdom and you may come up with great things.

## History

Previously I already posted what ChatGPT present to me, but i change the initial input to be act like a Screenwriter, and asked to improve the descriptions of the character and invent some more details.

> **Elysia**:
> Elysia is a blue-skinned alien from a distant planet called Valtoria, located in the outer reaches of the galaxy. Valtoria is a technologically advanced world, home to a highly intelligent and resourceful species of blue-skinned humanoids. Elysia grew up in a bustling city on Valtoria, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and advanced transportation systems.
> Elysia is a striking and distinctive-looking alien, with bright blue skin and a tall, slender build. She has long, flowing hair that is a slightly darker shade of blue than her skin, and it is styled in loose waves that fall down her back. Elysia has piercing green eyes that seem to glow with an inner fire, and she has a strong, angular jawline that gives her a fierce and determined expression. Despite her fearsome reputation as a bounty hunter, Elysia has a softer side, and she is known for her kindness and compassion. She often wears simple, functional clothing that allows her to move freely and comfortably, but she also has a taste for fine fabrics and jewelry, and she is not afraid to dress up when the occasion calls for it.
> Elysia was a happy and carefree young alien, with a bright future ahead of her. However, her life was forever changed when her younger sister was killed by Zander.
> Zander is a cruel and ruthless intergalactic criminal with a long list of crimes to his name. He comes from a distant planet called Kronos, which is known for its lawless and dangerous environment. Zander grew up as an orphan on the streets of Kronos, learning to survive by any means necessary. As he grew older, Zander turned to a life of crime, becoming a master thief and con artist. He quickly rose through the ranks of the criminal underworld, building a vast network of connections and allies. However, his greed and ambition eventually led him to cross paths with Elysia's younger sister, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Zander killed her without a second thought, leaving Elysia grief-stricken and determined to bring him to justice.
> Determined to bring Zander to justice, Elysia threw herself into the world of bounty hunting, using her combat skills and knowledge to track down and capture criminals throughout the galaxy.
> Elysia is a fierce and intelligent warrior, driven by a deep sense of loss and a desire to right the wrongs of the galaxy. She is also a loyal friend and teammate, always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. Despite her tough exterior, Elysia is compassionate and caring, and she will stop at nothing to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who have wronged her.

> **Jack:**
> Jack is a human bounty hunter who has been working in the galaxy for many years. He is in his middle age, with short, graying hair and a neatly trimmed beard. Despite the roughness of his profession, Jack takes care of his appearance, and he is often impeccably dressed in stylish yet practical clothing. He has a strong, athletic build, and he is skilled in both hand-to-hand combat and the use of various weapons. Despite his tough exterior, Jack is a kind and compassionate person at heart, and he has always been drawn to helping others.
> Jack grew up on a rough and dangerous planet called New Frontier, where he learned to fend for himself at a young age. He first started working as a bounty hunter to pursue his love for a girl named Sarah, who was the daughter of a famous bounty hunter known as "Warrior" William. He hoped that by joining the profession, he could prove himself worthy of her and win her heart. However, things did not go as planned, and Sarah was tragically killed by a group of criminals seeking revenge for the capture of one of their leaders by Jack and her father.
> Heartbroken and filled with a desire for justice, Jack stayed in the bounty hunting business, using his natural talent for tracking down his targets and his fearless attitude to succeed in some of the most dangerous missions.
> Jack has a deep-seated fear of failure, and he often struggles with anxiety and self-doubt. To cope with the stress and grief of Sarah's death, Jack turned to smoking as a way to calm his nerves and focus his thoughts. He can often be seen with a smoke in hand when he is on a mission, and he finds it hard to break the habit despite the dangers.
> Despite his flaws, Jack is a reliable and dedicated partner, and he always puts the safety of his team and the success of the mission first. He is fiercely loyal to those he cares about and will stop at nothing to protect the innocent and bring justice to the galaxy.

> **Back story:**
> Jack and Elysia first met while working on separate bounties to capture a notorious thief known as "The Ghost," who had stolen a valuable artifact from a wealthy collector. The Ghost had evaded capture for years, and the reward for his capture was substantial. Both Jack and Elysia were determined to bring The Ghost to justice, and they initially competed against each other to see who could capture him first.
> However, things became complicated when The Ghost's accomplices began targeting both Jack and Elysia in an effort to protect their leader. Despite their initial competition, Jack and Elysia were forced to work together to evade the attacks and track down The Ghost. As they worked together, they realized that they made a formidable team, with complementary skills and a shared dedication to justice.

If your read careful, I asked to ChatGPT for more detail physical descriptions.

## Midjourney

As I mention above, in my previous post DALL-E was used to generate the images, but now let's bring the big guns in image generation, Midjourney v4 is one of the state of art in this field (we also have now Stable Diffusion).

To generate this excellent images I used a technique that i watch on YouTube, and the author had share over [pastbin][2].
Adding those commands at the end of image description bring great details and excellent images.

Another great research to create images in different style is this [github repository][3].

![Characters][4]

> Top - Bottom

- Elysia
- Jack
- Zander
- Elysia & Jack starship
- Cyberpunk Alley for some adventure
- Zander starfighter;

Do the images look too much generic for you? Well they were made by an AI, with descriptions generated by another AI, there's no much more to say.

Go out and experiment these AI's to see their advantage and limitations.
And please don't get fooled by false guru's saying that AGI is near ... this is nonsense.
